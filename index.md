## Part 1 and Part2
Still working on it. I haven't been able to figure out how to build a server or getting a path for my SSH key. I apoligize. I will complete it soon and be able to demonstrate it in my resubmission.

## Part 3
Before week 2, I did not even know what a server is. Now I learned how servers and clients are connected and I can do that on my terminal using commands. Also, being able to remotely sign in and control a computer distant from my location was interesting to learn. For week 3, I had a little bit of experience with VS code but never run a terminal on it, so that was new to me. Learning how to learn ssh-keygen was very new to me and I think it is going to be useful in the future.
